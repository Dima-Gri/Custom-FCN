# Custom-FCN
Realization of custom fully connected network with own activations, layers, dataloader, optimizers ans criterions

In `modules` I implemented:
1. layers: `Linear`, `BatchNormalization`, `Dropout`, `Sequential`
2. optimizers: `SGD`, `Adam`
3. criterions: `MSELoss`, `CrossEntropyLoss`
4. activations: `ReLU`, `Sigmoid`, `Softmax`, `LogSoftmax`
5. data loader

All this used such as in torch

Also I add tests for checking. They launch in ipynb notebook. Example of full pipeline also contained in ipynb notebook.
